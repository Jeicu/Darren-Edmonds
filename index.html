    <h1> Darren Edmonds' Personal Website </h1>
    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a junior at the Johns Hopkins University majoring in Applied Math and Statistics and minoring in Computer Science. 
      I live in San Diego with my dad, mom, and younger brother, and enjoy going to the gym and reading in my spare time. </p>
      
    <p> Over the summer of 2018, I became interested in computer science and began to pick up the skills required to create my own projects. 
      I plan to use this website to document my journey from a novice programmer to (hopefully!) a seasoned professional. I hope you 
      find my projects interesting; feel free to contact me if you have any questions! </p>
